- Sources without results: shard 1
- Errors outside any test (INC-589): none

## Errors outside any test (INC-589)

None: no results file lists one and no log's summary names one (18 of 19 results files read, 18 of 19 logs read).

## Backend start failure (INC-973)

The temporary backend never came up, so these sources have neither results nor a lane log: shard 1. The start log's error lines, redacted, from `shard 1` (one lane's lines stand for every lane that failed the same way):
